I finally found the exact area of forest where The Return of the Jedi speeder bike scene was filmed! It took some Googling, mapping, and all of my free time this past weekend but I managed to trek out and follow the Speeder Bike chase trail to the location of the AT-ST and Ewok battle. I could almost smell the blaster plasma and burnt mammal hair in the air. It was surreal.

That made me wonder... Can I find Diagon Alley? Platform 9 ¾? Maybe even Hogwarts? I might need to start planning a little trip to England for when I accrue enough vacation time.
